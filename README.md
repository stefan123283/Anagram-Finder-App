# What the program does?

The program processes a text file with a list of words, groups the anagrams and prints them on the same line in a new text file.

# What is an anagram?

An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

# How to use the project?

1. Clone the git repository in the desired location.

2. Open the downloaded folder using your preferred Java IDE.

3.  Provide a list of words that should be grouped into anagrams in the **___sample.txt___** file located in the _**files**_ folder, or you can use the one already provided. **Note** that only one word should be added per line, otherwise the program will not work as expected.

4. Run the Main.java class. A file named _**result.txt**_ should appear in the _**files**_ folder. Open it, and you will see the anagrams printed on the same line.
