# What the project does?

The application processes a text file with a list of words then groups the words that are anagrams and prints them on the same line in a new text file.

# What is an anagram?

An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

# How to use the project?

1. Clone the git repository.

2. You can provide a list of words to be grouped into anagrams in the sample.txt file located in the files folder, or you can use the one that is already provided.

3. Run the Main.java class. A file named result.txt should appear in the files folder. Open it and you will see the anagrams printed on the same line.

Good luck!
